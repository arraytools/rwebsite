## Setting up BRB-SeqTools

### Download BRB-SeqTools

The tarball can be extracted to the desktop or any other place under your $HOME directory by using either the file manager (called Nautilus in Ubuntu) or a terminal command (use the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+Alt+t' to open a terminal).

```{bash eval = FALSE}
tar -xzvf seqtools-dl-1.2.tar.gz
```

This will create a new directory called seqtools-dl. This new directory contains the following files:

- `SeqTools`: GUI version of the application
